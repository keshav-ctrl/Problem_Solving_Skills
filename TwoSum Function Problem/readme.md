This is simple problem which I found in the lead code problem test.

This problem states that input any array of integers and on the basis of target value find the which members of that array sum is equal to the target value.

To solve this problem I make the class like solution and create the function(TwoSum) and for the test of the function I create the object of solution and call the fuctions. 


I use frute force  approached.

A brute force algorithm is a simple, comprehensive search strategy that systematically explores every option until a problem’s answer is discovered. It’s a generic approach to problem-solving that’s employed when the issue is small enough to make an in-depth investigation possible.
